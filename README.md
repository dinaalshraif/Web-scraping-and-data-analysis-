# Web Scraping and Data Analysis

#### Project's Aim 
This project aims to extract data from a website and then process and analyse them. The website that was selected is called Maroof. Maroof is a Saudi initiative that has the objective of supporting businesses to have an online channel in order to bloom the E-commerce market in the Kingdom.

#### Why Maroof? 
Maroof is a national platform that contains Saudi stores data, which means that it is rich with retail data for different sizes of businesses. Although it was initially designed for small and medium businesses, however, nowadays, it also represents large companies in Saudi Arabia. 

#### Data Elements That Extracted from Maroof
